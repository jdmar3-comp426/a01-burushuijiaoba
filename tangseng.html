    <h1>Tripitaka(Tang Sanzang)</h1>
    <p class="startp">
      In the novel, Tang Sanzang is a Chinese Buddhist monk who is actually a reincarnation of Golden Cicada, a disciple of the Buddha. 
      Tang Sanzang is originally the posthumous son of Tang Palace Graduate Chen Guangrui and the Prime Minister's daughter, Yin Wenjiao. 
      After being awarded the first place in a national examination, Chen Guangrui is appointed Prefect of Jiangzhou. While on his way to take office, 
      he is murdered by a ferryman named Liu Hong, who also abducts his wife and takes his place as Prefect. When Chen's son is born, 
      Yin Wenjiao puts the baby on a wooden board and sets him floating adrift down the Yangzi River, out of fear of him being killed by Liu Hong. 
      The baby reaches a monastery and is found by the Abbot, who names him Xuanzang and raises him as a Buddhist novice. When Xuanzang turns 18, 
      he is reunited with his father, whose body was saved by the Dragon King of River Hong; together they look for Yin Wenjiao and bring Liu Hong to justice.
      He is sent by the Emperor Taizong on a mission to Tianzhu (an ancient Chinese name for India) to fetch a set of Buddhist scriptures back to China for 
      the purpose of spreading Buddhism in his native land. He becomes sworn brothers with the Emperor of the Tang Dynasty, and the emperor sees him off from 
      the capital Chang'an with two escorts to accompany him. Tang Sanzang is helpless at defending himself and his two escorts are killed during his first 
      encounter with demons after his departure from Chang'an. The bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara (Guanyin) helps Tang Sanzang find three powerful supernatural 
      beings – Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing (a monkey, pig and fish spirit respectively) – to aid and protect him on his journey. The three become 
      Tang Sanzang's disciples and receive enlightenment and redemption for their past sins once the pilgrimage is complete. Along the journey, Tang Sanzang 
      is constantly terrorised by monsters and demons due to a legend which says that one can attain immortality by consuming his flesh because he is a reincarnation of a 
      holy being. At the end of the novel, Tang Sanzang is appointed as the Buddha of Sandalwood Merit</p>
