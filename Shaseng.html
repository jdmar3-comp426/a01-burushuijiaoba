    <h1>Monk Sha(Sha Wujing)</h1>
    <p class="startp">
      Like Zhu Bajie, Wujing was originally a general in Heaven, more specifically a Curtain-Lifting General.
      In a fit of rage, he destroyed a valuable vase. Other sources say that he had done this unintentionally, and it was an accident.
      Nevertheless, he was punished by the Jade Emperor, who had him struck 800 times with a rod and exiled to earth, where he was to be
      reincarnated as a terrible man-eating sand demon. There, he lived in the Liúshā-hé.
      Each day, seven flying swords sent from Heaven would stab him in the chest and then return. He had to live in the river to avoid the punishment.
      Wujing's appearance was grisly. He had a red beard and he was partially bald. A necklace consisting of skulls made him even more terrible.
      He still carried the weapon he had in Heaven, a magic wooden staff created by Lu Ban. According to one story, an earlier group of nine monks
      on a pilgrimage west to fetch the scriptures met their end at the hands of Wujing. Heedless of their pleas for mercy, he devoured them, sucked
      the marrow from their bones, and threw their skulls into the river. Unlike his other victims whose bone sank to the river bottom, the skulls of
      the monks floated. This fascinated and delighted Wujing, who strung them on a rope and played with them when he was bored. Later, Guanyin, the
      bodhisattva of compassion, and her disciple Prince Moksha came searching for powerful bodyguards in preparation of Tang Sanzang's journey west.
      She recruited Wujing, in exchange for which, she granted some respite from his suffering. She then converted him to Buddhism and gave him his
      current name, Shā Wùjìng. His surname Shā ("sand") was taken from his river home, while his new name Wùjìng means "awakened to purity" or
      "aware of purity". Finally, he was instructed to wait for a monk who would call for him. When Wujing does meet Tang Sanzang, he is mistaken for
      an enemy and attacked by Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie. Guanyin is forced to intervene for the sake of the journey. After the misunderstanding was
      cleared up, Wujing became the third disciple of Tang Sanzang, who called him Shā-héshàng . Now, he was clad in a Buddhist pilgrim's robe and his skull-necklace was turned
      into a bhikkhu's one. During the Journey to the West, his swimming ability was useful. He always carried a small gourd which he could turn into a
      huge one, in order to cross rivers. Wujing was a kind-hearted and obedient person and loyal to his master. Amongst the trio, he was likely the most
      polite and the most logical. At the journey's end, Buddha transformed him into an arhat known as the Golden-bodied arhat. As the third disciple, even
      though his fighting skills are not as great as that of Wukong or Bajie, he is still a great warrior protecting Tang Sanzang and can use his intellect
      as well as his strength to beat the enemy. He knows only 18 forms of transformation and, in the middle of the story, admits as much.</p>
